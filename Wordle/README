	Project Description
This project is a take on the popular game Wordle. The user is given a word to guess and the game
responds with hints until the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses. The user has
six attempts to guess the word correctly. Letters that are the suer guesses in the correct place
are highlighted green and letters that are in the word but are in the incorrect location are
highlighted yellow.
