	Project Description
For the choose your own assignment, I decided to create my own version of hangman. I found a list
of words online and then created a program that reads in this file to a vector for use throughout.
The program prompts the user with a set of blank spaces that correlate to the randomly chosen word.
The user enters in letters until they use all six guesses to complete the hangman, guess the word
correctly, or quit the game using by pressing shift and Q. The program displays the letters that
have already been guessed and does not penalize the user for hissing the same jey twice, it instead
informs the user of their mistake. After each round, the user is promted to play again or exit. The
user can also exit at any time by pressing shift and Q. The program also does not allow for users
in input anything other than lower case letters.

     Known Bugs

	Additional Notes
